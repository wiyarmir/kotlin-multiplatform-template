# Kotlin Multiplatform Template

Template that will give you a ready-to-go project including:

- Backend project with Ktor at [backend/](/backend)
- Frontend project with KotlinJS and React Kotlin at [web/](/web)
- Android App project with KotlinJVM at [android/](/android)
- iOS App project with KotlinNative at [ios/](/ios)
- Shared network, domain and presentation at [common/](/common)

*Looking for a project with just Android and iOS? It's here: https://github.com/wiyarmir/kotlin-multiplatform-mobile-template*

*Looking for a project with just Backend and Web? It's here: https://github.com/wiyarmir/kotlin-multiplatform-frontend-template*

## Building and running the project

### Backend

There is a Gradle task that will produce a JAR ready to go.

```bash
$ ./gradlew stage
```

The output is in `backend/build/libs/backend-release.jar`.

The following environment variables are recognised:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| PORT | Port where the server will run and listen to incoming connections |
| ENVIRONMENT | Can be either `production` or `development`. If absent, will assume `development`. |

You can run the backend development server executing:

```bash
$ ./gradlew backend:run
```

This will start serving the app in port 9090 by default. 

### Web

If you want to run the frontend development server, you can execute:

```bash
$ ./gradlew web:run
```

This will start the webpack development server in port 8080, and proxy all calls to files it doesn't know to port 9090.

If you want the frontend development server to connect to the development backend, you'll need to pass the flag `-Pdebug`.

```bash
$ ./gradlew web:run -Pdebug
```

**Warning**: The webpack development server will keep running until you execute `./gradlew web:stop`.

#### Hot reloading

In backend, Ktor supports hot reloading, but since the task serving the app is kept alive, you need to execute in a separate console:

```bash
$ ./gradlew backend:classes -t
```

This will recompilate classes on file changes, and Ktor will detect it and reload them on the next request it serves.

For the frontend, it's enough to execute the original run task with `-t` flag.

```bash
$ ./gradlew web:run -t
```

### Android

Open the root project in Android Studio or IntelliJ, and it will recognise the Android App configuration after a
successful Gradle sync. You can use that configuration to run, debug and profile the app.

### iOS

Open the workspace located at [ios/KotlinMultiplatformTemplate.xcworkspace](/ios/KotlinMultiplatformTemplate.xcworkspace) 
in XCode. The Podfile includes an entry to the common code with an extra user script for it to be recompiled as a build 
step.

## Deployment

### Backend

There is a `Procfile` that will JustWork™️ on Heroku or Herokuish environments (think [Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku)).

### Frontend

By default, the web bundle and a default `index.html` are included in the backend jar and served at `/`.
